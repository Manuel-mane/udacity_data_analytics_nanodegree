Once you're ready to finish your presentation, check your output by using nbconvert to export the notebook and set up a server for the 
slides. From the terminal or command line, use the following expression:

jupyter nbconvert <file_name>.ipynb --to slides --post serve --template output_toggle

This should open a tab in your web browser where you can scroll through your presentation. Sub-slides can be accessed by pressing 'down' 
when viewing its parent slide. Make sure you remove all of the quote-formatted guide notes like this one before you finish your 
presentation!
