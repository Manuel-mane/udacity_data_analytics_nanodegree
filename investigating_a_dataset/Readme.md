# Investigating a dataset

This project takes part of the second part of the program **Introduction to Data Analysis**.

**Investigating a dataset** is an end to end project where I analyze a dataset I choose and retrieve conclusions and find insights which we can decisions upon or extract valuable information from. For this I mainly use Python focused on Pandas and Matplotlib.
