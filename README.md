# Data Analytics Nanodegree

This folder contains the different projects I worked on during the nanodegree of Data Analytics offered by Udacity.

### Projects:

**Investigationg a Dataset:**

Using Python: Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib, to answer business questions from a dataset. Provide final summary with extracted insights.

**Analysis of A/B Test Results:** 

Using Python: Numpy and Pandas, to perform practical statistical analysis and hypothesis test to understand the result of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 

**Wrangle and Analyze Data:**

I gather data from a variety of sources (3 different sources) and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. I showcase my wrangling efforts through analyses and visualizations.

**Communicate Data Findings:**

After I chose a dataset, I performed an exploratory data analysis using Python. Then, I created a presentation with explanatory plots that conveyed your findings.
